Explanation
Outer while n > 1: Loop
Purpose: This loop continues as long as n is greater than 1. The goal is to break down n into its prime factors.
Why n > 1?: The process of factoring continues until n is completely factored down to 1.
Inner while n % divisor == 0: Loop
Purpose: This loop checks if n is divisible by the current divisor. If it is, it means that divisor is a factor of n.
n % divisor == 0: This condition is true when n is exactly divisible by divisor with no remainder, meaning divisor is a factor of n.
operations += divisor
What it does: Each time the inner loop runs, it adds the current divisor to the operations count.
Why?: Adding the divisor to the operations count corresponds to the idea that creating n copies of H by using this divisor as a factor requires a sequence of operations. Specifically, it represents the combined cost of copying the current text and then pasting it multiple times (as determined by the factor).
n //= divisor
What it does: This line divides n by divisor and assigns the result back to n.
Why?: This reduces n by removing the factor represented by divisor. For example, if n is 12 and divisor is 2, after dividing, n becomes 6. This reflects that you've handled the operations related to multiplying by 2, and you now need to continue with the remaining factor.
divisor += 1
What it does: After the inner loop finishes (when n is no longer divisible by the current divisor), this line increments divisor by 1 to check the next potential factor.
Why?: The loop needs to test the next smallest possible factor of n. If divisor was 2 and the inner loop finished, the next divisor checked would be 3, and so on.
Putting It All Together
The code is essentially breaking down n into its prime factors and using those factors to determine the minimum number of operations required to get n Hs. Each factor represents a sequence of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations, and the sum of these factors gives the minimum operations.

Example
Let's say n = 12.

Step 1: divisor = 2, n = 12

12 is divisible by 2.
operations += 2 (Now operations = 2)
n //= 2 (Now n = 6)
Step 2: divisor = 2, n = 6

6 is divisible by 2.
operations += 2 (Now operations = 4)
n //= 2 (Now n = 3)
Step 3: divisor = 3, n = 3

3 is divisible by 3.
operations += 3 (Now operations = 7)
n //= 3 (Now n = 1)
Now n = 1, so the outer loop stops, and the total number of operations is 7.
