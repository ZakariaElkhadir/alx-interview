# 0x06. Star Wars API

## Description
The "0. Star Wars Characters" project requires you to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument.

## Concepts Needed
To successfully complete this project, you need to be familiar with the following key concepts:

1. **HTTP Requests in JavaScript**: Understanding how to make HTTP requests to fetch data from an API.
2. **Working with APIs**: Knowing how to interact with and extract data from an external API.
3. **Asynchronous Programming**: Handling asynchronous operations, such as API requests, in JavaScript.
4. **Command Line Arguments in Node.js**: Passing arguments to a Node.js script from the command line.
5. **Array Manipulation and Iteration**: Manipulating and iterating over arrays of data.

## Additional Resources
By familiarizing yourself with these concepts and resources, you will be able to efficiently retrieve, process, and display Star Wars characters from the specified movie using the Star Wars API, demonstrating your ability to work with external APIs and manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.

## Requirements
- General
  - Your code should use the `semi-standard` style (version 15.0.0).
  - All your files should end with a new line.
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
  - Your code should be `node` compatible.
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`.
  - All your executable files should have the correct permissions (e.g., `chmod u+x file.js`).
