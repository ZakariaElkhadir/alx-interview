# Overview
This project involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

## Key Concepts
* Matrix Representation in Python
* In-place Operations
* Matrix Transposition
* Reversing Rows in a Matrix
* Nested Loops

## Resources
* Python Official Documentation
* GeeksforGeeks Articles
* TutorialsPoint

## Objective
To rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise using in-place operations, requiring a good understanding of matrix manipulation and algorithmic thinking in Python.
